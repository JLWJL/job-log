## Job Log

This project was originally built for learning React and REST API with NodeJS, somehow it's also helped me manage my own job applications.

## Prerequisites:

* **NodeJS**
* **Yarn / NPM**

## Build & Run

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run build:dev`
3. `yarn run start`

Go to `localhost:8000`

It's the same to use **npm** to execute the above commands.

To make the application functional, please build and run [job-log-api](https://github.com/ryanwng/job-log-api) as well.
